# Introduction
The log4r package is meant to provide a clean, lightweight object-oriented approach to logging in R based roughly on the widely emulated log4j API. The example code below shows how the logger is used in practice to print output to a simple plaintext log file.

# Installation
At present, this package is not robust enough to be released on CRAN. If you would like to use it, please `git clone` this repository and then run the following command from inside the cloned repository:

    R CMD INSTALL log4r_*.tar.gz

# Example Code
    # Import the log4r package.
    library('log4r')
    
    # Create a new logger object with create.logger().
    logger <- create.logger()
    
    # Set the logger's file output: currently only allows flat files.
    logfile(logger) <- file.path('base.log')
    
    # Set the current level of the logger.
    level(logger) <- log4r:::INFO
    
    # Try logging messages at different priority levels.
    debug(logger, 'A Debugging Message') # Won't print anything
    info(logger, 'An Info Message')
    warn(logger, 'A Warning Message')
    error(logger, 'An Error Message')
    fatal(logger, 'A Fatal Error Message')

# The log4r Priority Levels
`log4r` supports five priority levels. In order from lowest to highest
priority, they are:

* `log4r:::DEBUG`
* `log4r:::INFO`
* `log4r:::WARN`
* `log4r:::ERROR`
* `log4r:::FATAL`

# Keep in Mind
* Calling `logfile(logger) <- file.path('logs', 'my.log')` will fail if the `logs` directory does not already exist. In general, no effort is made to create non-existent directories.
* Only messages at or above the current priority level are logged. Messages below this level are simply ignored.

# Future Changes
* `create.logger()` will become a singleton method to insure log integrity.
* Future versions of log4r will respect the format attribute of logger objects.
